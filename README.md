These labs are 100% correct (in the red group slight differences to other groups if compared)

all code was created by me (AwesomeSauce106)

I have lost access to the hidden questions for lab 1 and 2, they are not included for that reason

lab 2:
  retirement ( if statements )
  driverCategory ( switch statements { could be a if either they are inter-changeable }  ) 
  calculator       ^
  restaurantReviews ^
  busFares ( this demonstrates the ternary operator )
