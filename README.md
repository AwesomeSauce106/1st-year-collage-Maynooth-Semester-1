These labs are 100% correct (in the red group slight differences to other groups if compared)

The different labs are on the different branches

comments get included in code from lab 3 onwards

all code was created by me (AwesomeSauce106)

I have lost access to the hidden questions for lab 1 and 2, they are not included for that reason
